- Library Dependencies: Authentication library, WebSocket handlers

## Implementation Details

### Architecture Overview
The application follows a microservices architecture with separate services for:
- Chat management
- Authentication
- AI integration
- WebSocket communication

### Data Flow
1. User sends message → WebSocket server
2. Message processed → OpenAI API
3. Response received → User interface
4. Data stored → MongoDB

### Component Interactions
- Frontend components communicate via Redux/Context
- Backend services communicate via REST/WebSocket
- Database interactions through Mongoose ODM

### Security Considerations
- JWT-based authentication
- API key encryption
- Rate limiting
- XSS protection
- CORS configuration

### Performance Optimizations
- Message pagination
- Response streaming
- WebSocket connection pooling
- Database indexing

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Jest for component testing
- Mocha for backend testing
- Mock OpenAI API responses

### Integration Testing
- API endpoint testing
- WebSocket communication testing
- Database operations testing

### Performance Testing
- Load testing with Artillery
- Stress testing for concurrent users
- API response time monitoring

## Deployment Strategy

### Staging Environment
- Automated deployment to staging servers
- Integration testing execution
- Performance benchmarking

### Production Environment
- Blue-green deployment
- Automated scaling policies
- Database replication

### Rollback Procedures
- Automated rollback triggers
- Database backup restoration
- Version control management

## Timeline and Milestones

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (4 weeks)
- Duration: 1 month
- Deliverables:
  - Project setup and configuration
  - Basic UI implementation
  - OpenAI API integration

### Phase 2: Core Features (8 weeks)
