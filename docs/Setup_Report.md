# Report: Setting Up Projects in VSCode with Multiple ClineAI Agents

This report outlines the process of organizing projects in VSCode to work effectively with multiple ClineAI agents, ensuring that each AI task remains manageable and within token limits.

---

## 1. Overview

To efficiently manage complex projects involving multiple AI tasks, we propose a structured approach that:

- Establishes a top-level workflow that integrates all sub-workflows.
- Separates the codebase into individual VSCode projects within `/src/libs`, with each subfolder representing a class or feature.
- Utilizes `task_classname.yaml` and `project_tasks.yaml` files to keep AI tasks organized and within the 40K token limit.
- Employs a `cline_init` script to automate the creation and updating of the project structure based on a `project.yaml` configuration file.
- Incorporates Git version control to manage code changes and collaboration effectively.

---

## 2. Project Structure

The project directory will be organized as follows:

```
/project_root/
├── project.yaml
├── project_tasks.yaml
├── src/
│   ├── main_project_files...
│   ├── libs/
│   │   ├── ClassName1/
│   │   │   ├── ClassName1.code-workspace
│   │   │   ├── task_ClassName1.yaml
│   │   │   ├── code_files...
│   │   │   └── ai_chatlogs/
│   │   ├── ClassName2/
│   │   │   ├── ClassName2.code-workspace
│   │   │   ├── task_ClassName2.yaml
│   │   │   ├── code_files...
│   │   │   └── ai_chatlogs/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── workflows/
│       ├── main_workflow.yaml
│       └── sub_workflows/
│           ├── workflow_ClassName1.yaml
│           ├── workflow_ClassName2.yaml
│           └── ...
└── .git/ (if Git is initialized)
```

- **`project.yaml`**: Contains overall project configuration.
- **`project_tasks.yaml`**: Tracks AI tasks across the project.
- **`/src/libs/`**: Contains subfolders for each class or feature.
- **`ClassNameX/`**: Individual VSCode project for a class.
  - **`ClassNameX.code-workspace`**: VSCode workspace file.
  - **`task_ClassNameX.yaml`**: AI task definition for the class.
  - **`ai_chatlogs/`**: Directory to store AI chat logs.
  - **`code_files...`**: Source code files for the class.
- **`/src/workflows/`**: Contains the main workflow and sub-workflow definitions.
  - **`main_workflow.yaml`**: Defines the top-level workflow integrating all sub-workflows.
  - **`sub_workflows/`**: Contains individual workflow definitions for each class.
- **`.git/`**: Git repository directory (hidden).

---

## 3. The `cline_init` Script

The `cline_init` script automates project setup and updates based on `project.yaml`, managing both the top-level workflow and sub-workflows.

**Key Functions:**

- Reads `project.yaml` for project settings, class definitions, and workflow configurations.
- Creates or updates the `/src/libs/` directory structure.
- Generates individual VSCode projects for each class in `/src/libs/`.
- Generates workflow files in `/src/workflows/`, including `main_workflow.yaml` and sub-workflow files.
- Creates `task_ClassNameX.yaml` files for AI task management.
- Ensures each class subfolder is self-contained with its own AI chat logs and code files.
- Manages the integration of sub-workflows into the main workflow.
- Handles Git initialization and branch management.

**Script Workflow:**

1. **Initialization**:
   - Run the script in the project root directory.
   - Parse `project.yaml` for classes, features, and workflow definitions.

2. **Git Setup**:
   - Check if a Git repository exists in the project root.
   - If none exists, initialize a new Git repository using `git init`.
   - Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., `node_modules/`, `ai_chatlogs/`).

3. **Subfolder Creation**:
   - For each class, create a subfolder in `/src/libs/` named after the class.
   - Initialize a new VSCode workspace within the class subfolder.

4. **Branch Management**:
   - Create a new Git branch for each class or feature (e.g., `feature/ClassNameX`).
   - Check out the branch in the corresponding subfolder.

5. **Workflow Generation**:
   - Create `main_workflow.yaml` in `/src/workflows/`.
   - For each class, create a `workflow_ClassNameX.yaml` in `/src/workflows/sub_workflows/`.
   - Update `main_workflow.yaml` to include references to all sub-workflows.

6. **File Generation**:
   - Create `task_ClassNameX.yaml` for each class.
   - Set up an `ai_chatlogs/` directory to store AI interactions.

7. **Updating Existing Projects**:
   - The script detects new classes or workflows added to `project.yaml` and updates the project structure accordingly.
   - It updates existing directories without overwriting code files or chat logs.

---

## 4. Top-Level Workflow Management

- **Main Workflow (`main_workflow.yaml`)**:
  - Acts as the orchestrator for all sub-workflows.
  - Defines the order and dependencies between sub-workflows.
  - Ensures cohesive integration of all project components.

- **Sub-Workflows (`workflow_ClassNameX.yaml`)**:
  - Define the specific tasks and processes for each class.
  - Allow for isolated development and testing of individual features.
  - Facilitate reusability and modularity.

- **Script Responsibilities**:
  - The `cline_init` script updates `main_workflow.yaml` whenever new sub-workflows are added.
  - Manages the inclusion and sequence of sub-workflows in the main workflow.
  - Ensures consistency across workflow definitions.

---

## 5. Managing AI Tasks

- **Token Limit Considerations**:
  - Keeping AI tasks below 40K tokens ensures efficient processing.
  - By separating tasks into individual `task_ClassNameX.yaml` files, each AI agent works within manageable limits.

- **Chat Logs**:
  - Storing AI chat logs in each class's `ai_chatlogs/` directory keeps interactions organized and easily accessible.

- **Project-wide Task Tracking**:
  - `project_tasks.yaml` provides an overview of all AI tasks.
  - Workflows reference these tasks to maintain alignment between code and AI processes.

---

## 6. Development Workflow

**Adding a New Feature or Class:**

1. Update `project.yaml` with the new class and workflow definitions.
2. Run `cline_init` to generate the new class subfolder and workflow files.
3. The script initializes a new Git branch for the feature.
4. Develop the feature within its dedicated subfolder.
5. Update `workflow_ClassNameX.yaml` with specific tasks for the feature.
6. The `cline_init` script updates `main_workflow.yaml` to include the new sub-workflow.
7. Integration with the main project occurs in `/src/`, where code from all classes is collected.

**Merging Changes:**

- After development and testing, merge the feature branch back into the `main` branch.
- Use Git commands or tools within VSCode to handle merges.
- Resolve any conflicts that arise during the merge process.

**Benefits:**

- **Modularity**: Encapsulates features, making code maintenance and updates more manageable.
- **Version Control**: Git tracks changes, allowing for rollback and collaborative development.
- **Centralized Workflow Management**: The main workflow provides a clear overview of the project's execution flow.
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple developers or AI agents can work on different classes and workflows simultaneously without conflicts.
- **Scalability**: Easily accommodates new features by updating `project.yaml` and rerunning `cline_init`.

## 7. Git Repository Best Practices

Implementing Git version control is crucial for collaborative development and maintaining code history. Below are best practices for integrating Git into the proposed project structure.

### Initializing the Git Repository

- **Single Repository**: Use a single Git repository at the project root (`/project_root/`) to manage the entire codebase.
- **Script Integration**:
  - The `cline_init` script checks for an existing Git repository.
  - If none exists, it initializes a new repository using `git init`.
  - Creates a `.gitignore` file with common exclusions:
    - `node_modules/`
    - `ai_chatlogs/`
    - Temporary files (e.g., `.DS_Store`, `*.log`)

### Branch Management

- **Feature Branches for Subprojects**:
  - Create separate branches for each class or feature.
  - **Naming Convention**: `feature/ClassNameX`.
  - Allows isolated development on individual features.

- **Script Functionality**:
  - Automates branch creation with `git branch feature/ClassNameX`.
  - Checks out the branch in each subproject using `git checkout feature/ClassNameX`.

### Subproject Integration

- **Merging Feature Branches**:
  - After completion and testing, merge feature branches into the `main` branch.
  - Use pull requests and code reviews when collaborating with multiple developers or AI agents.

- **Conflict Resolution**:
  - Address merge conflicts promptly.
  - Maintain clear communication among team members.

### Collaboration

- **Remote Repository**:
  - Set up a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) for backups and collaboration.
  - The script can prompt for remote repository details during initialization.

- **Access Control**:
  - Manage permissions to control access to different branches and features.
  - Utilize SSH keys or personal access tokens for authentication.

### Best Practices

- **Commit Messages**:
  - Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
  - Include references to tasks or issues when applicable.

- **Commit Frequency**:
  - Commit changes regularly to track progress and facilitate rollbacks if necessary.

- **Branch Naming Conventions**:
  - Use consistent naming for branches (e.g., `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`).

- **Code Reviews**:
  - Implement code review processes to maintain code quality.
  - Peer reviews can catch issues before they merge into the main codebase.

## 12. Script Feedback Mechanisms

The communication between scripts and Cline can occur through two distinct feedback channels, ensuring proper integration of script operations with AI workflows.

### Direct Terminal Integration

When Cline initiates a script:
1. Terminal output is automatically captured
2. Output becomes part of the Cline chatlog
3. Enables real-time feedback during script execution
4. Allows AI to respond to script output directly

**Benefits:**
- Immediate feedback loop
- Automatic documentation of script execution
- Context preservation in AI conversation
- Real-time error handling

**Implementation:**
```python
def execute_with_feedback():
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(['command'], capture_output=True, text=True)
        print(f"Output: {result.stdout}")  # Captured in Cline chatlog
        print(f"Errors: {result.stderr}")  # Captured in Cline chatlog
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {str(e)}")  # Captured in Cline chatlog
```

### Log File Generation

For user/programmer-controlled feedback:
1. Script generates structured log files
2. Logs are stored in predefined locations
3. Users can manually include logs in Cline conversations
4. Provides flexibility in feedback timing

**Log Structure:**
```yaml
# script_execution.log
timestamp: "2024-01-20T10:30:00Z"
operation: "project_initialization"
status: "success"
details:
  - step: "directory_creation"
    status: "completed"
    path: "/project/src/libs"
  - step: "workspace_setup"
    status: "completed"
    files_created: 3
errors: []
warnings: []
```

**Benefits:**
- Controlled feedback inclusion
- Detailed execution records
- Structured data format
- Selective information sharing

### Integration with Workflow

1. **Direct Terminal Output:**
   - Used for immediate script-AI interaction
   - Suitable for interactive operations
   - Maintains conversation context
   - Enables real-time decision making

2. **Log Files:**
   - Used for detailed post-execution analysis
   - Supports batch processing review
   - Enables selective information sharing
   - Facilitates debugging and auditing

3. **Combined Usage:**
   - Scripts can implement both mechanisms
   - Terminal output for immediate feedback
   - Logs for detailed record-keeping
   - Flexible integration based on needs

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Terminal Output:**
   ```python
   # In script
   def report_progress(step, status):
       print(f"[CLINE_FEEDBACK] {step}: {status}")
       sys.stdout.flush()  # Ensure immediate output
   ```

2. **Log Generation:**
   ```python
   # In script
   def write_log(operation_data):
       log_path = "ai_chatlogs/script_execution.log"
       with open(log_path, 'a') as f:
           yaml.dump(operation_data, f)
   ```

3. **Configuration:**
   ```yaml
   # In project.yaml
   feedback:
     terminal_output: true
     log_generation:
       enabled: true
       path: "ai_chatlogs"
       format: "yaml"
   ```

This dual feedback system ensures comprehensive communication between scripts and Cline, allowing for both automated and manual integration of script operations into the AI workflow.
